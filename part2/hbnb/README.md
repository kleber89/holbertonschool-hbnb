# HBNB

## Part 2: : Implementation of Business Logic and API Endpoints

## Description
In this phase of the HBnB project, you'll implement the core functionality of the application using Python and Flask. This will involve building the Presentation and Business logic layers, and defining essential classes, methods and API endpoints, based on the design developed in the previous part.

The goal is to bring the documented architecture to life by creating the project structure, develop the business logic, and implement key functionality such as managing users, places, reviews, and amenities.
